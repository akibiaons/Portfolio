user_description: With five years in frontend and two in backend development, I craft webpages from Figma designs using JavaScript, NextJS, React, and TailwindCSS, along with a suite of libraries. On the backend, I'm skilled in MySQL, Node, Express, and leverage tools like Prisma, PlanetScale, Firebase, among others, to build robust solutions.
